# Depression Prediction

In this project, the objective is to predict depression based on the various factors like gender,marital status, pregnancy, work life, sleeping pattern, health problems etc. 

Project Scope: We have a survey data taken among citizens of US. Our task as a data scientist is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict the depression based on these factors like gender,marital status, pregnancy, work life, sleeping pattern, health problems etc. The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input customer details and receive prediction instantly.
